 This method perform duplication transaction checking function. It checks whether duplicate transactions and saves duplicate transaction logs. Inside, saveDplctnChkTx (String) and checkDplctnTx (String) are called. 1. Duplication Check: If a value (attribute list) is registered in the service duplication check attribute (srvcDplctnChkAtrbtCntnt) of the service profile, duplicate check is performed. accordingly the duplicate check transaction log (SvSrvcDplctnChkTxL) is inserted or updated. 2. Duplicate Check Transaction Log Insert (Perform normal transaction): When there is no duplicate log. 3. Duplicate Check Transaction Log Update (Perform Confirmation Transaction): When performing a confirmation transaction (there are duplicated transactions, but performed once more). 4. Execute Return Transaction: When performing a return transaction (due to duplicated transaction, the current transaction is not performed).

 This method is used to define whether to perform the verification logic of whether negative balance is allowed when the balance of the general ledger is updated. (1) If the value of whether negative balance is allowed is not 'Y' due to the nature of the account subject, an error is processed so that the negative balance is not updated. (2) It is defined through the custom class so that the processing of (1) above can be skipped according to the development and test environment or the business requirements of the site.

 It sets the transfer amount validation exclusion attribute. The validation exclusion attribute is stored in the memory area and is used to validate amount of financial transaction. With this method, transfer amount validation will not be proceeded in financial transaction. 
 It sets the transfer amount validation exclusion attribute. The validation exclusion attribute is stored in the memory area and is used to validate amount of financial transaction. With this method, transfer amount validation will not be proceeded in financial transaction. 
 It sets the attribute of accounting processing possibility all at once without executing post-service processing. This attribute is used when it is necessary to call the accounting module without executing post-service processing. If the attribute is set, then accounting processing will be executed without post-service processing when settlement component create arrangement transaction. 
 It inquires the attribute of accounting processing possibility all at once. If the attribute is Y, then accounting processing will be executed without post service handler when settlement component create arrangement transaction. 
 This method is for executing post process of accounting component. This method call final processing for accounting and journalizing process to complete journalizing. It supports to check accounting rule for journalizing based on common context accounting journalizing area. If there is no problem, then update accounting log, staff transaction history, teller transaction summation. After checking accounting processing in deferred mode, then process general ledger reflection, staff transaction accounting summation and insert accounting journalization entry.

 It check if arrangement is blocked on specific arrangement service type enum Verify that Service Blocking is registered in this arrangement for the arrangement service type entered. In the case of that Service Blocking('Proof of balance') is registered for service type('Interest payment'), if you check isArrServiceBlocked(ArrSrvcEnum.InterestPayment), it returns 'TRUE'. If you get the arrangement using external id number, it confirms that whether the Service Blocking is registered for the service type in the external id number. if it is, it shows error message ('the external ID is service blocked') When you want to check with service type code not with service type enum, you can use {@link #isArrServiceBlocked(String)}
